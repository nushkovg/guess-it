## Guess It!

#### Guess It! is the third in the series of Vanilla JS excercise projects.

#### It is a guess the number game which allows the user to try 3 times to guess a random number between 1 and 10. The main focus here is excercising DOM manipulation by using events, math calculation, displaying flash error messages, and event delegation. Also, the exercise has focus on code optimization by wrapping repeatable code in reusable functions, the JS style.

#### The style is certainly not the main focus here, however, the minimal Skeleton boilerplate is used.
